#WorthTheTrip
This is an incomplete web application that aims to find points of interest between a source and a destination and then create a new route using these points of interest.

## How it Works
... Or at least, how it's going to work:

1. Have start/end location pair
    * _Eventually user should be able to use autcomplete_
2. Create a route
3. Retrieve waypoints from route
4. Find optimal distance to search for places from each waypoint
5. Store the places
6. _Allow user to choose places to visit_
7. _Create a new route_

_Italics_ denotes a task that hasn't even been started yet.


## Current State of the Project
Places of a given type show up within the desired radii of waypoints. Check github issues pages for more details.


## History
This project was started at TAMUHack in October 2014 with Chih-yen Chang, Laura Vaughan, and Kyle Wilson. 

I was quite fond of the project and wanted to learn more about using GitHub so I worked on it during my winter break (January 2015). Unfortunately, I got impatient and added some features (autocomplete for places) before finishing the main functionality. This quite greatly obscured where my issues were coming from once they inevitably started occuring. 

I've recently gotten back to it (September 2015) and reverted the change where I was too ambitious/impatient.
